### Electricity Usage Prediction
#### Objective
To simulate a machine learning model as a web app that predicts daily electricity consumption in kilo-Watt-hour (kWh).
The linear regression model in this web app is primarily implemented and evaluated using numpy, pandas, and seaborn libraries.
This app utilizes the Steel Industry Energy Consumption dataset from UCI machine learning repository website.
