![web_app_screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a25bfe09-e368-47fc-92e6-c6d77b2c688f)
#### *Objective*
To simulate a machine learning model as a web app that predicts daily electricity consumption using streamlit library.
The linear regression model in this web app was primarily implemented and evaluated using numpy, pandas, matlplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
This app utilizes [the Steel Industry Energy Consumption dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/851/steel+industry+energy+consumption) from UCI machine learning repository website.
* [Go to streamlit web app](https://electricity-usage-prediction.streamlit.app/)
